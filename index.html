  I'm a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. I grew up Vienna, Austria. People sometimes <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=no+kangaroos+in+austria&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">confuse the two</a>. One day I would like to live in Europe again.

<p>
  Currently I'm working for <a href="http://www.clearinteractive.com.au">Clear Interactive</a> in Melbourne. We're building software for the web and iPhone using a special blend of agile methodologies. Compared with the <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/programs/bp096">Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Engineering)</a> that I completed in 2007 with distinctions, it's refreshing.

  If you want to talk shop you can find me hanging out with the <a href="http://rubyonrails.com.au/melbourne-meetups">Melbourne Ruby Users Group</a> or the <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/">Melbourne Cocoaheads</a> (which I founded in July 2007).

<p>
  When the planets align correctly I like to try my hand at surfing on the weekends (I suck, if you're wondering). Otherwise I'll be hiding behind a camera lens somewhere. Be sure to say hi if you spot me.
